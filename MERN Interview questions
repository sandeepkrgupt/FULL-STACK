============================ MONGO DB ==============================================================
1. What is “Namespace” in MongoDB?

MongoDB stores BSON (Binary Interchange and Structure Object Notation) objects in the collection. 
The concatenation of the collection name and database name is called a namespace.

2. While creating Schema in MongoDB what are the points need to be taken in consideration?

Points need to be taken in consideration are

Design your schema according to user requirements
Combine objects into one document if you use them together. Otherwise, separate them
Do joins while write, and not when it is on read
For most frequent use cases optimize your schema
Do complex aggregation in the schema

3. What is the syntax to create a collection and to drop a collection in MongoDB?
Syntax to create collection in MongoDB is db.createCollection(name,options)
Syntax to drop collection in MongoDB is db.collection.drop()
9) Explain what is the role of profiler in MongoDB?

MongoDB database profiler shows performance characteristics of each operation against the database. 
You can find queries using the profiler that are slower than they should be.

4. To do safe backups what is the feature in MongoDB that you can use?
Journaling is the feature in MongoDB that you can use to do safe backups.

5 Mention what is the command syntax for inserting a document?

For inserting a document command syntax is database.collection.insert (document).

6. What is the command syntax that tells you whether you are on the master server or not? 
And how many master does MongoDB allow?

Command syntax Db.isMaster() will tell you whether you are on the master server or not.
MongoDB allows only one master server, while couchDB allows multiple masters.

7. Explain what are indexes in MongoDB?

Indexes are special structures in MongoDB, 
which stores a small portion of the data set in an easy to traverse form.
Ordered by the value of the field specified in the index, 
the index stores the value of a specific field or set of fields.

8. Mention what is the basic syntax to use index in MongoDB?

The basic syntax to use in MongoDB is >db.COLLECTION_NAME.ensureIndex ( {KEY:1} ). 
In here the key is the the name of the COLUMN (or KEY:VALUE pair) which is present in the documents.

9. What are some of the advantages of MongoDB?
Some advantages of MongoDB are as follows:

MongoDB supports field, range-based, string pattern matching type queries. for searching the data in the database 
MongoDB support primary and secondary index on any fields
MongoDB basically uses JavaScript objects in place of procedures
MongoDB uses a dynamic database schema
MongoDB is very easy to scale up or down
MongoDB has inbuilt support for data partitioning (Sharding)

10. What are Databases in MongoDB?
MongoDB groups collections into databases. MongoDB can host several databases, each grouping together collections. 
Some reserved database names are as follows:
admin
local
config

11. What is the Mongo Shell?
It is a JavaScript shell that allows interaction with a MongoDB instance from the command line. With that one can perform administrative functions, inspecting an instance, or exploring MongoDB. 

To start the shell, run the mongo executable:

$ mongod
$ mongo
MongoDB shell version: 4.2.0
connecting to: test

>12. What are some features of MongoDB?
Indexing: It supports generic secondary indexes and provides unique, compound, geospatial, and full-text indexing capabilities as well.
Aggregation: It provides an aggregation framework based on the concept of data processing pipelines.
Special collection and index types: It supports time-to-live (TTL) collections for data that should expire at a certain time
File storage: It supports an easy-to-use protocol for storing large files and file metadata.
Sharding: Sharding is the process of splitting data up across machines
