1.virtual dom vs shadow dom
Shadow DOM is a tool used to build component-based apps and websites. 
Shadow DOM comes in small pieces, and it doesnâ€™t represent the whole Document Object Model.
for example video tag , we use only video tag but it shows play/pause button , 
volume button, dowload option.

2. What is a stub in Node.js ?
A small program routine that substitutes for a longer program 
which is possible to be loaded later or that is remotely located.

Features of stub:

Stubs can be either anonymous.
Stubs can be wrapped into existing functions. 
When we wrap a stub into the existing function the original function is not called.
Stubs are functions or programs that affect the behavior of components or modules.
Stubs are dummy objects for testing.
Stubs implement a pre-programmed response.
